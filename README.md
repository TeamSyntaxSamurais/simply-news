# Simply News  
Just the news, the way you want it. A single app to read all the news you rely on to think, live and get ahead.

This git repository will help you get up and running quickly with Simply News.

Instead of checking the 50 websites you follow, now, with the help of the Simply News app, users can *simply* open the RSS reader app to read each website's top stories - all in one place.

This news aggregation application compiles news feeds from online sources using Sinatra, Nokogiri and SQL.

This app is available for web, iOS and Android.
